## Course Overview

Imagine calling a **real estate agent** and instantly getting the information you need. üè†

No hold times, no missed calls. In this course, we'll guide you step by step to build a fully functional **Real Estate Voice Agent**.

This smart assistant will be **accessible by phone**, ready to **answer property questions**, **schedule viewings**, and make the **buying or renting journey smoother** than ever!

By the end of this course, you'll have built your own voice agent, capable of:

* Answering calls and understanding customer inquiries üìû
* Providing detailed property information instantly üèòÔ∏è
* Scheduling viewings and appointments üìÖ
* Accessing property databases and CRM systems üíæ
* Handling multiple calls simultaneously ‚ö°
* Operating 24/7 without breaks üåô

>Transform customer service with AI that never sleeps!

Excited? Let's get started! 

**Try the current demo:**
```bash
uv sync
uv run python scripts/voice_agent_demo.py
```

> üöß **Current Status**: Basic voice conversation works! The real estate features (property database, scheduling, phone integration) are in development.

## Who is this course for?

This course is for Software Engineers, ML Engineers, and AI Engineers who want to level up by building real-time voice AI applications. It's not just a basic tutorial‚Äîit's a deep dive into making production-ready voice agents.

## What you'll get out of this course

* Build a fully functional real estate voice agent that handles phone calls
* Learn to integrate with property databases and CRM systems
* Implement appointment scheduling and customer management
* Set up phone integration for real-world deployment
* Build intelligent conversation flows for sales and support
* Deploy production-ready voice AI on cloud infrastructure
* Handle multiple simultaneous calls with smart routing
* Create voice agents for any business vertical

## Getting started

Before you begin, you need:

1. **Install Ollama** and pull a model:
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ollama pull qwen3:1.7b
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Test your setup**:
   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/voice_agent_demo.py
   ```

> Make sure your microphone and speakers are working! This demo shows the core voice capabilities that we'll extend into a full real estate agent.

## How much is this going to cost me?

The awesome thing about this project is **you can run it on your own computer for free!**

Everything runs locally - no API costs, no cloud bills. Perfect for development and testing your real estate voice agent.

When we deploy to production with phone integration, we'll show you cost-effective cloud options that scale with your business.
